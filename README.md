# lizmap-tool-demo

This repository contains a complete example showing how to create a new tool into [Lizmap](https://github.com/3liz/lizmap-web-client). The demo is based on Lizmap 3.1.11.

## Running the demo

To run this project on your machine, you can clone this repository and run it with docker-compose:

- ```git clone https://github.com/opengisch/lizmap-tool-demo.git```
- ```cd lizmap-tool-demo```
- ```docker-compose up```

The project should be now available at http://localhost:9980/

## The docker part

The `docker-compose.yml` file launch a Lizmap and a QGIS server containers and mount the host directory `projects` into both containers. In this directory we put the QGIS project and the javascript codes of our tool.

## The QGIS part

The demo QGIS project (`demo.qgs`) into the `project` directory is a simple project with 2 layers containing some random features.

Inside the `projects` directory there is the Lizmap config file `demo.qgs.cfg` generated by the [Lizmap QGIS plugin](https://github.com/3liz/lizmap-plugin)
